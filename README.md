# 🌌 Constellation

**Constellation** is a distributed computing platform that connects researchers with volunteers who contribute spare computing power to accelerate scientific discovery.

Researchers can upload computational projects, which are broken into small tasks and distributed across participating machines. Volunteers earn recognition for their contributions while supporting real-world research in areas like climate modeling, biology, and AI.

The system is built on **Ray**, enabling scalable task distribution, progress tracking, and result aggregation. Future iterations will include security mechanisms for sandboxing and verification to ensure correctness and trustworthiness across volunteer devices.
